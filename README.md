This is a color guessing game. On top, the RGB color code of a randomly picked color is displayed, for example RGB(123, 231, 213). You have to guess which of the squares below uses this color.

# What is RGB?
<br>
RGB is a color model used on computer screens. Each color is composed of three components, Red, Green and Blue. Each component is given as a number between 0 and 255. 0 means total absence of that component, 255 means the component is present in its fullest intensity. This gives over 16.7 million combinations.

If all three components are 0, no color is present and gives black. If all three components are 255, the intensity is at maximum and gives white.

RGB Combo explained

RGB(255, 0, 0) gives red
RGB(0, 255, 0) gives green
RGB(0, 0, 255) gives blue
RGB(255, 255, 0) gives yellow
RGB(255, 0, 255) gives magenta
RGB(0, 255, 255) gives cyan
